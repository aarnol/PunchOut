# Final Project Proposal: XR Arcade

*Legally not Punch Out*


*Alex Arnold*

## Project Description

My project would be a boxing game where you physically punch with your fists. There would also be enemies that hit back that you can either block or dodge by moving your body. It would take place in some kind of arena but you would not be  able to move around around physically.

## Feature Breakdown

In this section please fill out a table or list of the features you plan to implement for this project and how challenging you view them to be for you (on a scale of 1 to 5). Here is an example of the format I am looking for:

1. **Punching**: Player physically punches to hit some target or enemy
    1. **Estimated Challenge - 1:** Should be very easy, just need to have colliders be the right size
2. **Dodging and Blocking**: Player can hold hands up to block or move out of the way of incoming punches
    1. **Estimated Challenge - 3:**Dodging should be fine as long as I can get the hitbox to move corectly but detecting when a player is blocking could be challenging without using buttons.
3. **Enemy**: An enemy boxer 
    1. **Estimated Challenge - 1:**Only difficult part of the enemy itself is getting it at the proper distance from the player by trial and error.
4. **Enemy AI**: The enemy detects what is happening and chooses whether to block or punch
    1. **Estimated Challenge - 4:** Not entirely sure how to implement this to make it interesting. Could have the AI know when the player is about to punch and sometimes block. It would be slower than the player so they could react as well. Will probably need to be tuned.
## Milestones

List here the progress you intend to make by each milestone check point. The dates I have represented here are actual due dates for project submissions. These will also be in class time to get feedback from me and other students, so you must have something ready to test by class on each of these days.

1. **By 11/19** - Everything but the enemy. Implement basic targets at first instead of enemies.
2. **By 12/5** - Implement the enemy and enemy AI
